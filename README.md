# Who is Greg Dwyer?

Well, the short and sweet version is I am an aspiring programming student, with a love of puns and a bit too much caffeine.
I have too many hobbies to keep track of and a passion for making things work, be they electronic, mechanical or theoretical.

I am looking for an internship or position where I can work with a team to solve problems.

### What experience do you have?
I have an AAS in Audio Recording Technology, 5+ years of electronics repair experience and a couple of years of self taught coding experience prior to my current education.

My biggest coding accomplishment at this point is a game for Android based on a board game called [British Square](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=firstfrontiergames.britishsquare.apk). It was written using the AppGameKit engine and uses a C based language. Try the HTML5 version [here](/HTML5/British_Squares.html)!
