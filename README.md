# Who is Greg Dwyer?

Well, the short and sweet version is I am an aspiring programming student, with a love of puns and a bit too much caffeine.
I have too many hobbies to keep track of and a passion for making things work, be they electronic, mechanical or theoretical.

I am looking for an internship or position where I can work with a team to solve problems.

### What experience do you have?
I have an AAS in Audio Recording Technology, 5+ years of electronics repair experience and a couple of years of self taught coding experience prior to my current education. My full résumé can be obtained [here](/imgs/Dwyer, Gregory - Resume.pdf).

### Projects
My biggest coding project at this point is a game for Android, based on a board game called [British Square](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=firstfrontiergames.britishsquare.apk). It was written using the AppGameKit engine and uses a C based language. Try the HTML5 version [here](/HTML5/British_Squares.html)!

The full source code for British Square as well as a few other examples of my work are available on my Git Hub profile page.

Most recently I built electronics project was a mini portable arcade. The gallery can be viewed [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/7Pxfr6jfeDeYnJdX9).

I also built a portable secondary monitor for dual screens on the go. Images can be found in this [gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/MP6mkUqGMsDGZiSs9).
