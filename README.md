## But really, who are you?

Well, the short and sweet version is I am an aspiring programming student, with a love of puns and a bit too much caffeine.
I have too many hobbies to keep track of and a passion for making things work, be they electronic, mechanical or theoretical.

### Sounds...good?...What experience do you have?
I have an AAS in Audio Recording Technology, 5+ years of electronics repair experience and a couple of years of self taught coding experience prior to my current educatoin.

Reasons you should want me on your project
(i.e. Things I bring to the table)

- I will get it done, or deprive myself of sleep trying.
- My word play humor may not be funny, 
      but it will keep you on your toes.
- I dabble in all sorts of fields: 
      graphic design, video editing, circuit design...
- I have two cats, I can _definitely_ bring them to the table.
- I've been known to bring donughts from time to time.
